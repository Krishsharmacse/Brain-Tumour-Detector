        "description": "Gliomas are tumors that originate in the glial cells of the brain or spine. They are often aggressive and may affect brain function.",
        "prescription": "Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy (e.g., temozolomide), and targeted drug therapy. Regular MRI scans and follow-ups are essential.",
        "prevention": "While not entirely preventable, reducing radiation exposure and avoiding carcinogens may lower risk. Healthy lifestyle and early diagnosis improve outcomes."
    },
    "meningioma": {
        "description": "Meningiomas arise from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Most are benign but can grow and press on brain tissue.",
        "prescription": "Often treated with surgical removal. Radiation therapy may be used if surgery isn‚Äôt an option or the tumor is not fully removed.",
        "prevention": "There is no known prevention, but early imaging if symptoms arise (e.g., headaches, vision problems) can help in timely intervention."
    },
    "notumor": {
        "description": "No brain tumor detected in the MRI scan. The brain appears structurally normal.",
        "prescription": "No medical intervention required. Maintain regular health checkups and consult a neurologist if symptoms persist.",
        "prevention": "Follow a brain-healthy lifestyle: avoid smoking, limit alcohol, exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, and manage stress."
    },
    "pituitary": {
        "description": "Pituitary tumors form in the pituitary gland. They can affect hormone production and cause vision issues due to proximity to the optic nerve.",
        "prescription": "Treatment includes medication (e.g., dopamine agonists), surgery (transsphenoidal resection), and radiation. Hormone replacement may be necessary.",
        "prevention": "Most pituitary tumors aren‚Äôt preventable. Early detection and endocrine evaluation are key for effective treatment."
